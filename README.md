# GSM-SGD-for-Structured-Pruning
This repo implements Global Sparse Momentum SGD and further extend it to structured pruning.

The codes for MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet experiments are within mnist/ and cifar/ folder respectively. Please follow the jupyter notebook file in each folder to run the experiments. Codes are tested with Pytorch 1.5.1 and Python 3.6.10, tqdm package is preferred for better visualization of the training process.
